# sci-vs-news
## Attempting to cluster and track what is discussed primarily in top journals and conventions through abstracts vs what is described in news articles.

The goal of this project is to track what is being most discussed in high impact scientific journals and conferences with with respect to what is being discussed and focused on in news articles.

As of now, my intended primary data source for the scientific articles is through Google Scholar via python's scholarly package/API. While new headlines and articles are regularly searchable through https://newsapi.org/, I will primarily be searching through science articles that are heavily shared rather than focusing in primarily on reputable newspapers as what headlines are shared is likely going to be more informative to what is being discussed than if a newspaper took proper steps in sourcing and understanding the subject of their articles.
